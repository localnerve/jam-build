# Jam Build

> A web application reference of a custom static site, but as a versionable, offline, service-worker MPA, with batching, multi-user OCC, RBAC authz, and data on top.

> Minimal, hand-crafted vanillajs by a human.

## Project Summary

### Overview

This project serves as a starting point for a web application. It builds a versionable, offline-first, multi-page JAM (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) web app with support for multi-user data.

### Key Features

* **Service Worker First:**
  * The project design centers around a service worker, which is different from most web applications.

* **Custom Sass/Handlebars Static Site Generator:** 
  * A multi-page application built using a custom static site generator that leverages Sass and Handlebars.
  * Image processors generate metadata used to render preload tags and other performance-oriented styles and markup.
  * CSS Classes are generated from template names for optional specificity.
  * Static site only [branch](https://github.com/localnerve/jam-build/tree/front-only).

* **Offline Capabilities:**
  * Pages are rendered directly from the service worker cache using a stale-while-revalidate strategy.
  * Service worker manages offline data updates and reconciliation when the network is restored.

* **Version Updates:** 
  * The service worker handles version updates and ensures that users receive the latest static pages and app versions.
  * Supports versioned deployment for both front-end and back-end components.

* **Service Worker Data Update Batching:**
  * Data mutations are staged in IndexedDB and committed to the API in offline supported batch processes, optimized for resource usage.

* **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**
  * The service worker and data service handle multi-user optimistic concurrency control with three-way merge resolution.

* **Role-Based Access Control:**
  * Supports role-based access control for different user roles (e.g., user, admin).

* **Reusable, General Data Design:**
  * Features a reusable, general data design with application and user regions.

* **Established Toolchain:**
  * Uses a well-established toolchain with no magic (no hidden or complex processes) and minimal dependencies.

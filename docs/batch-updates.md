# Batch Update Processing Flow

The Jam-Build application uses a sophisticated batching system to efficiently synchronize local data mutations with the remote API while handling offline scenarios and version conflicts.

## Key Points

* The batching window prevents chatty API calls
* The consolidation algorithm handles complex put/delete precedence rules
* The conflict resolution with 3-way merge is enterprise-grade
* Background sync provides offline resilience

## Overview

When users modify data through the UI proxy, changes are queued and batched to minimize network requests and handle concurrent operations intelligently.

## Process Flow

1. User Mutation ‚Üí Data changes trigger the proxy system in `client/main/stores.js`

2. Local Storage ‚Üí Changes are immediately written to IndexedDB for instant UI feedback

3. Batch Queuing ‚Üí A `batch-update` message is sent to the service worker with operation details
4. Timer Window ‚Üí Operations are collected in a 67ms window (extending with each new mutation)

5. Consolidation ‚Üí When the timer expires, operations are deduplicated and ordered:

    * Groups by `storeType:document:collection`
    * Newer deletes override older puts for the same data
    * Merges multiple puts to the same collection
    * Orders network calls from oldest to newest

6. Network Sync ‚Üí Consolidated operations are sent to the remote API

7. Conflict Resolution ‚Üí If version conflicts occur:

    * Fetches latest remote version
    * Performs 3-way merge (base + remote + local)
    * Local changes always win conflicts
    * Re-queues resolved operations and restarts batch processing

8. Cleanup ‚Üí Successful operations are removed from the batch queue

## Key Features

* Offline Support: Failed operations are queued for background sync
* Multi-user Safe: Optimistic concurrency control with conflict resolution
* Performance Optimized: Batching reduces API calls and handles burst mutations
* Data Consistency: 3-way merge ensures no user data is lost during conflicts

## Error Handling

* Network failures ‚Üí Background sync retry queue
* Version conflicts ‚Üí Automatic 3-way merge and retry
* API errors ‚Üí Reconciliation via data refresh

---

**Note:** The recursive conflict resolution currently lacks exponential backoff, which should be implemented to prevent infinite retry loops in pathological scenarios.
